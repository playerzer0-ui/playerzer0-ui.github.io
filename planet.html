            <p>The mysterious planet appeared out of nowhere in sector B8-NII</p>

            <br />
            <p><em>"2020 is a strange year for us to live" </em></p>

            <p>The planet looks just like earth, has rich resources and plenty of vegetation as well as some animals. The planet has oxygen and gravity which allows astronauts to strip off their suits and run freely while it's not affected by the pandemic. But what interests us are the flying fishes and whales randomly appearing every night.</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>NASA decides to take action and assert dominance to the planet in the name of random domination. They also take a picture a night in a tent. "If a whale thinks us as a glowing plankton, do a coffin dance for my funeral please" claimed the first mate.</p>
