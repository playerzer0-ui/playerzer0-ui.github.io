For the files and unflattened images, you might find some are compressed to save space

One of the .psd and .kra file has a blank white screen to save space as well (that is not part of the project so just delete it)

that one is a link to a certain audio file.

P.S.

Isn't 31 MB a bit of an overkill, 
and when can we have face-to-face meetings again, I personally feel it's much more effective for a programming class
rather than online.
