        <h1>A level-5 Lifeform? Here on planet Earth???</h1>
        <section id="section1">
            <p>Scientists received a mysterious call from space just a few months ago. The call shocked an entire facility due to its message</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p><em>"Yo what's up homies! We are on earth! look at us swag XD (love the memes)"</em></p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>"ALIENS!!!! COME HERE Y'ALL ENIGMATIC GREEN WHATEVERS," shouted Prof. Azizi as he slowly drifted to insanity whilst hearing the message. He always believed aliens exist even though people called him a fool. Prof. Azizi made the biggest "I told you so" in the entire history</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>But it did not end here, Prof. Azizi claims the alien to be a level 5 lifeform due to its very existence bending reality itself, he backed up his theory through the picture that alien sent. According to him, that picture wasn't edited as the aliens had no knowledge on photoshop. They are also taken place at a familiar location but people cannot see them.</p>
